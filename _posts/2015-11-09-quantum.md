# Quantum

for using the word in the area of electricity. However, the word quantum in general was well known before 1900\.[Hermann von Helmholtz][0], who credited [Philipp Lenard][1] "quantus", meaning "how much". "Quanta", short for "quanta of electricity" (electrons) was used in a 1902 article on the photoelectric effect by [Latin][2]The word "quantum" comes from the \[2\] were physicians as well as physicists. Helmholtz used "quantum" with reference to heat in his article[Julius von Mayer][3]. Both Helmholtz and [quantum satis][4], such as in the term [physicians][5] It was often used by \[3\] by Mayer in his letter[first law of thermodynamics][6] on Mayer's work, and indeed, the word "quantum" can be found in the formulation of the \[4\] used "quanta" to mean "quanta of matter and electricity",[Max Planck][7] dated July 24, 1841\. \[5\] gas, and heat.\[6\] ("Lichtquanta").["quanta of light"][8] existed in spatially localized packets which he called [radiation][9] suggested that [Albert Einstein][10] In 1905, in response to Planck's work and the experimental work of Lenard (who explained his results by using the term "quanta of electricity"), \[7\]

. By assuming that energy can only be absorbed or released in tiny, differential, discrete packets he called "bundles" or "energy elements",[black-body radiation][11] from heated objects, known as [radiation][9]The concept of quantization of radiation was discovered in 1900 by Max Planck, who had been trying to understand the emission of \[8\] Planck accounted for the fact that certain objects change colour when heated.\[9\], and introduced the idea of quantization for the first time as a part of his research on black-body radiation.[German Physical Society][12] to the [revolutionary findings][13] On December 14, 1900, Planck reported his \[10\], to the German Physical Society. After his theory was validated, Planck was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1918 for his discovery.[electrical charge][14] and the unit of [mole][15], the number of real molecules in a [Avogadro--Loschmidt number][16], and could also report a more precise value for the [Planck constant][17], known as the _h_ As a result of his experiments, Planck deduced the numerical value of
